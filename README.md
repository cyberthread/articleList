# Exercise: Grid Layout for Article List
One unique feature of an article list is that you often have an unknown amount of articles in that list and need an efficient way to build a consistent layout for that module. What is extra cool is that you can create flexible and dynamic layouts that are responsive without ever needing to write a media query!

In this exercise we will explore a basic use of CSS Grid layout including the following: 
- CSS Properties
	- display
	- grid-gap
	- grid-template columns
- CSS Functions
	- [minmax()](https://gridbyexample.com/video/series-minmax/)
	- [repeat()](https://gridbyexample.com/video/series-repeat/)
- CSS Keywords
	- [auto-fill](https://gridbyexample.com/video/series-auto-fill-auto-fit/)
- CSS Units
	- [fr](https://gridbyexample.com/video/series-the-fr-unit/)
	- rem

## TASKS
Use the grid-layout module to design a flexible composition for the article list. To do this you will need to apply the grid style rules to the parent of the article list items. The columns should:
- All be the same width
- Should be at least 16rem 
- Be fluid/flexible
- Fit as many columns at each screen size
- Have 2rem of space between them

To do accomplish this task you will need to:
- Add the appropriate selector to the CSS in the designated area of the products.css stylesheet
- Write 3 (and only 3) style rules (or 3 properties)

## Submission
- Demonstrate your code working in a browser to your TA or instructor
- Show the CSS you wrote to your TA or instructor
